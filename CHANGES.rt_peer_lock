If peer is null, there is no need to acquire the lock.
    
Draw the truth table:
    
peer  rt->peer| peer  rt->peer
0     0       | 0     0
0     1       | 0     1
1     0       | NO CHANGE TO
1     1       | THE CODE HERE
    
The only time the code is executed is if peer != 0.
When peer == 0, the code does empty work by acquiring the lock.
