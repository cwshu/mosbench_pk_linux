Split up the hash bucket lock on the used ports hash table.
    
There is a per core data structure that stores owners and the owner count. A
core updates it's own local version. Updates on the hot paths access the local
copy. Cold path code that needs to aggregate the information from all cores
grabs all the per-cpu locks and consolidates the data in to one data structure.
    
Each socket on the owner list also keeps track of which list it is on.  This is
needed because a socket need to know which list to remove itself from.
